## Frequently Asked Kerbal Questions **FAQK** by [`godarklight`][godarklight]

### Q: Why isn't this on the forums?

>It was removed by pro kexico moderators!

### Q: How do I install this?

>Same way as any other mod, extract it to GameData/

### Q: How much does this cost?

>It's free! Kexico paid for it.

### Q: Where did you find the brick wall texture?

>Here: http://www.highresolutiontextures.com/stone-wall-brick-wall-free-textures

### Q: How do I make more walls, to keep more kexicans out?

>The mod loads the wall positions from wall.txt (next to the BuildTheWall.dll). If this file is missing, it goes into "Build mode", which is something I only very basically tested. You'll still need to adjust the altitude though afterwards, the format of the file is =PlanetName, and then the follow lines are wall segments in the form of latitude, longitude, altitude. Shave about 2 or 3 metres off each position and you should be fine :) 😁

### Q: Why did you do this?

>There's this thing called april fools, and it's been quite a while since I released NyanCat. That and I was disappointed that nobody ran with this idea yet.

### How do I contact you?

>Either PM me on the forums, or email me at godarklight@gmail.com

### Q: Wall warranty

>Wall warranty is void if used with ladders. For best results, do not allow kexicans to use ladders on the wall.

### Q: WHY? JUST WHY?

>Because.

### Q: This mod is awful!

>That isn't a question.
